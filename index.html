                    <br>
                    <p>I entered the University of Illinois during the Fall of 2014 as a transfer studend from
                    the College of Dupage. In my time here I have learned a lot about myself and engineering.
                    Starting out I was interested in how computers communicated with one another, but as time
                    went on that interest faded. Overall I became an engineer so that I could help people through
                    technology, but I just wasn't able to see how I could do it by figuring out how computer networks
                    are created. That's why web development is so facinating to me. In a very short time, one is
                    able to effect a lot of change through the internet. The prospects in this field are enormous
                    and so I've decided to dedicate a lot of my time in being apart of it.</p>
