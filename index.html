                    <br>
                    <p>During the Fall of 2014, I entered the University of Illinois, as a transfer student from the College of Dupage. In my time at UIUC, I have learned a lot about myself and engineering. Starting out, I was interested in how computers communicated across networks and the intricacies of their topology. But as time moved forward, that interest faded. Originally, I became intrigued in computer engineering, so I could help people better understand technology, but I just wasn't able to see how I could do it by attempting to figure out how computers were networked and created. However with web development, it was very intuitive to see how I might be able to help make people's lives easier. That's why web development is so fascinating to me. In a very short time, one is able to become an innovator. The prospects of web development are enormous, and so I've decided to dedicate much of my time to being apart of it.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Courser started as a learning platform for me to get used to the MEAN stack and learn
                    a bit about the DOM tree. It's grown quite a bit from an idea I had to a small functioning
                    website. The site uses MongoDB's built in search in order to find school courses that relate
                    to the search terms. This part of the site actually works fairly well, although I've wanted 
                    to change the way it searches so that it's more accurate. I'm soon planning on making a blog
                    for this site so I can track my progress. This is the biggest project I've worked on so far.
                    I'm proud of what I've created it and I hope that when it's finished, people will enjoy
                    using it as much as I enjoyed building it.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>After failing nearly every technical interview I had during the fall 2016 semester, I've
                    pledged to myself that I will complete at least 1 coding practice problem every day. This
                    is something that will hopefully sharpen my interviewing and general coding skills alike. Although
                    this isn't a typical project that would manifest itself into something tangible, I still 
                    consider it an outstanding use of time for myself. I've choosen to complete everything in python
                    as I believe this language is extremely versitle and would benifit me the most.</p>
