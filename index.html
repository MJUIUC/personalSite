                    <br>
                    <p>I entered the University of Illinois during the Fall of 2014 as a transfer studend from
                    the College of Dupage. In my time here I have learned a lot about myself and engineering.
                    Starting out I was interested in how computers communicated with one another, but as time
                    went on that interest faded. Overall I became an engineer so that I could help people through
                    technology, but I just wasn't able to see how I could do it by figuring out how computer networks
                    are created. That's why web development is so facinating to me. In a very short time, one is
                    able to effect a lot of change through the internet. The prospects in this field are enormous
                    and so I've decided to dedicate a lot of my time in being apart of it.</p>

                    <h3>Courser: an elective exploring project</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Courser started as a learning platform for me to get used to the MEAN stack and learn
                    a bit about the DOM tree. It's grown quite a bit from an idea I had to a small functioning
                    website. The website uses MongoDB's built in search in order to find school courses that relate
                    to the search terms. This part of the site actually works fairly well, although I've wanted 
                    to change the way it searches so that it's more accurate. I'm soon planning on making a blog
                    for this site so I can track my progress. This is the biggest project I've worked on so far.
                    I'm proud that I've created it all on my own and I hope that when I finish it, people will enjoy
                    using it as much as I will.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>After failing nearly every technical interview I had during the fall 2016 semester, I've
                    pledged to myself that I will complete at least 1 coding practice problem every day. This
                    is something that will hopefully sharpen my interviewing and general coding skills alike. Although
                    this isn't a typical project that would manifest itself into something tangible, I still 
                    consider it an outstanding use of time for myself. I've choosen to complete everything in python
                    as I believe this language is extremely versitle and would benifit me the most.</p>
